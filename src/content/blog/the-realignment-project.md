Greetings,
I’ve felt lost enough times. That anxiety, too many questions swirling, stress piling up but no idea what actions actually mattered to me. Through every phase of it, I found a way to survive. But I didn’t evolve. I didn’t thrive. And the demons in my mind? They’re patient.
For me, the journey to growth is the carrot and the stick: you run towards your dreams while you’re running from your nightmares. It’s about getting somewhere, not just getting by.
That’s why I made this questionnaire. It’s a template to get you aligned, and to help you figure out what actions truly push the needle. This isn’t just about answering questions; it’s about getting real clear and being intentional.
1. Vision of Your Ideal Self
Who do I want to become? Visualize your ideal self. What characteristics, values, and behaviors define this version of you?
What does success look like for my new identity? Define success on your own terms, not what society tells you.
How do I want others to perceive me? Think about how your identity impacts your relationships and social interactions.
What role do I want to play in the world around me? What’s your purpose? How do you want to contribute to the world?
2. Self-Discovery & Awareness
What do I truly want from life?
What am I passionate about?
What are my strengths?
What are my weaknesses?
What are my core values?
What gets me excited?
What am I lazy about?
How strong am I, mentally and emotionally?
What kind of environment do I thrive in?
What kind of people do I vibe with?
What makes me happy, and am I actively pursuing those things?
3. Breaking Barriers & Letting Go
What beliefs about myself are limiting my growth? Call out and reframe those self-imposed limitations.
What fears are preventing me from pursuing my goals? Challenge them. Work towards getting over them.
What aspects of my current identity do I want to release? Let go of habits, traits, or mindsets that just don’t work for you anymore.
What distractions are standing in my way? Identify the time-wasters, toxic relationships, or bad habits.
How can I reframe past experiences to support my transformation? Turn your past struggles into valuable lessons.
4. Building the New Identity
What new skills or knowledge do I need to acquire? What learning or experiences are necessary to become your ideal self?
What daily habits can I adopt to reinforce my new identity? Small, consistent actions are what lead to real, lasting change.
How do I motivate myself when challenges arise? Figure out what truly drives you.
What environments or relationships do I need to change to support my transformation? Look at your surroundings and who you spend time with.
What am I willing to sacrifice to become this version of myself? What are you ready to give up to make this happen?
5. Clarity & Direction
What do I NOT want out of life? Get super clear on what you absolutely don’t want.
What do I want out of life? What are your deepest desires and aspirations?
Time-Based Goals
10-Year Goals: Where do you see yourself in a decade?
1-Year Goals: What big steps can you hit in the next year?
3-Month Goals: What tangible progress can you make in the short term?
Skill & Growth Alignment
What skills and knowledge do I need to acquire? What do you need to learn or experience?
What obstacles or distractions could derail my progress? Name them so you can figure out how to deal with them.
6. Self-Reflection & Progress Tracking
What went well last week?
What didn’t go well?
What am I grateful for?
What are this week’s goals?
What are my current focus projects?
How far have I come in my journey?
What is the difference between how I see the world and how the world sees me?
How will I measure my progress in this transformation? Define clear milestones and figure out how you’ll hold yourself accountable.

So, that’s the questionnaire. Take your time with it. Seriously, don’t rush. Share it with your closest friends and family for their honest feedback. And yeah, go ahead and prompt it to a large language model like Gemini or ChatGPT for advice or to help you map out a roadmap.
All the best on your journey.
