Greetings,

I hope you are doing well.

Today, I am here to share my opinion, optimistically, on the AI Revolution.

I remember the day ChatGPT 2 was there, a very simple transformer that somehow managed to piece together words to try and find meaningful sentences. We have truly come a long way from then, so many different AI models — Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, Deepseek, Llama, and even more!

At the same time, the capabilities have skyrocketed, a conversational friend and confidante, a coach, a coding partner, a strategist, a designer, a video creator, etc. The list can be endless based on your specific needs, and it has become very difficult to distinguish between human and AI.

With the improvement in technology, there are AI detectors, that look at patterns, that look at specificity and structures of how AI converse. A field on its own.

After just thinking around this technology, its effect, and its usage, with its risk, and its benefits. I suddenly had this daunting on me — Did we just get the freedom to make mistakes?

It may not be factually correct, and with further research and surveys, this may just be a conspiracy theory that has no ends, but for now, entertain this and try to dwell in this reality.

AI has become the core component of everyone’s life, in one way or the other. At the same time, it strives for perfection by design, it is improving at a speed that has no boundaries, and there are research out there regarding self-developing models. So, where does that leave us, human?

Now, there is one doomsday reality, that we have all heard of, felt, or watched in a movie. Keeping the reality at bay, we look towards what benefits it can provide, optimistically.

Think about it, what does the AI understand or comprehend when you ask it — Can you make this more human? Humanize this? etc. You are asking it to be more free-flowing, not perfection, make it more creative rather than structured, make it more emotion, than code.

While, as we know, ChatGPT or Gemini, or Grok, none of them are able to humanize it properly, and it requires some edits, before or after, in prompt or to make it human by human. The idea remains, the job to strive for perfection has been delegated to the machine, which is what it is, using code and energy to assist us with our endeavors.

We get, the better half, in my opinion. The freedom to make mistakes, the freedom to be human, the freedom to experiment and people reading and going. Alas, atleast its not garbage created by an AI model.

Most of us now, have an idea of what AI sounds like. We now yearn for human voices.

That is my opinion.

Thank you.
