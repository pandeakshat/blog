**Greetings,**

I hope you are doing well.

This classic opening is my go-to for emails, articles, and professional conversations.

Today, I reflect on a drastic change in the timeline and roadmap I had previously planned. Questions swirl in my mind: Where did I go wrong? What should I have done differently? How can I better prepare? At the same time, I’ve watched countless YouTube videos and read Medium articles on “What I would do if I started from zero” as a Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Blockchain Developer, or similar roles.

Thus, setting aside all my skills and experience, I’m taking a deep dive into everything required, acquired, and refined. The following is my roadmap for becoming a data scientist, assuming I’ve reset my life.

## The Data Science Landscape

Data Science is a peculiar field of study and career — a disruptive technology in itself. Constantly evolving, it gathers insights to redefine its requirements, altering the trajectory of learning. Even with the same foundations, pathways diverge more each month. Since its inception, data science has evolved and reshaped multiple times. The advent and maturation of AI (or LLMs) has caused another shift in its form. The data science roadmap of today differs from last year’s, and the year before that, and it will likely differ next year as well. Yet, this is the essence of the journey.

Being a data scientist requires not only acquiring foundational skills but also embracing disruptive improvement. For some, like me, it’s a reset. For others, it’s a journey to map future requirements, identify emerging skills, and balance what’s become easier yet more complex. No matter the steps you take, this field demands constant realignment and refinement in our approach to understanding _data._

This roadmap is structured to guide you through this reset, disruption, and realignment. It focuses on three key areas: **required** foundational skills, **acquired** skills to stay relevant, and **refinement** of existing knowledge to excel in the evolving landscape.

## Phase 1: Required — Foundations

To embark on this journey, focus on the foundations — master the basics and solidify your understanding of the structure.

Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned data scientist, revisiting the foundations always enhances your knowledge, offering new or deeper insights.

Data Science foundations can be divided into four essential components:

1. Programming
    
2. Statistics & Probability
    
3. Mathematics
    
4. Data Wrangling & Visualization
    

**Programming**

> **Beginner**—

Master the fundamentals of Python, focusing on data structures, control flow, and object-oriented programming principles. Concurrently, build a strong command of SQL for data extraction and manipulation.

**Professional**—

Go beyond basic scripting. Optimize your Python code for efficiency. Explore advanced SQL techniques like window functions and common table expressions for complex querying.

**Statistics & Probability**

> **Beginner —

**Develop a strong intuition for core concepts like descriptive and inferential statistics, probability distributions, and hypothesis testing.

**Professional —

**Reconnect with the mathematical underpinnings of the models you use daily. Can you explain the assumptions behind a linear regression or the law of large numbers to a non-technical audience?

**Mathematics**

> **Beginner —

**Gain a solid understanding of linear algebra (vectors, matrices) and calculus (derivatives, gradients), as these are the bedrock of most machine learning algorithms.

**Professional —

**Don’t just know the concepts; understand their application in algorithms. How does a gradient descent algorithm utilize derivatives to find the minimum of a function?

**Data Wrangling & Visualization**

> **Beginner —

**Learn to use libraries like Pandas for data cleaning, transformation, and exploration. Become proficient in at least one visualization library, such as Matplotlib or Seaborn, to communicate findings effectively.

**Professional —

**Move beyond ad-hoc cleaning scripts. Focus on creating reproducible, well-documented data cleaning pipelines. Experiment with advanced or interactive visualization tools to tell compelling stories with your data.

## Phase 2: Acquired — Tools & Skills

The next phase of becoming a data scientist is choosing your tools and skills. While aiming for the best tools isn’t a bad strategy, sometimes what you need is what aligns with your skillset and foundations. These tools and skills are acquired through knowledge, experience, and experimentation to determine what you can utilize to its fullest potential.

The tools and skills tree is generally divided as follows:

1. Machine Learning Fundamentals
    
2. Cloud Computing
    
3. MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)
    
4. Big Data Technologies
    

**Machine Learning Fundamentals**

> **Beginner —

**Gain a comprehensive understanding of the theory and practical implementation of core supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.

**Professional —

**Deepen your expertise in specific areas of machine learning that align with your career goals, such as natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, or time-series analysis.

**Cloud Computing**

> **Beginner —

**Get hands-on experience with at least one major cloud platform (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure). Understand their core data services for storage, computation, and machine learning.

**Professional —

**Move beyond basic cloud services. Learn to architect and deploy scalable machine learning solutions on the cloud. Explore serverless computing and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).

**MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)**

> **Beginner —

**Understand the concepts of model deployment, version control (Git), and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) in the context of machine learning.

**Professional —

**Implement end-to-end MLOps pipelines. Gain proficiency in tools for model monitoring and experiment tracking. Focus on automating the machine learning lifecycle.

**Big Data Technologies**

> **Beginner —

**Get acquainted with the principles of distributed computing and the role of technologies like Apache Spark for processing large datasets.

**Professional —

**Gain practical experience in optimizing Spark jobs and working with distributed data storage solutions. Understand the trade-offs between different big data tools.

## Phase 3: Refine — Knowledge

The final phase, which is ongoing, is refinement. The foundations you’ve built, the skills you’ve acquired, and the information you’ve gathered through continuous learning all require refinement.

The goal is to communicate in a human way, present and understand insights, and produce results through storytelling.

Refinement occurs through the following:

1. Business Acumen
    
2. Communication & Storytelling
    
3. Ethical & Responsible AI
    
4. Lifelong Learning Mindset
    

**Business Acumen**
